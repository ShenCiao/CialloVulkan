# Ciallo

Ciallo～(∠・ω< )⌒★! Anime/Cartoon/2D computer graphics.

## Deprecated
The repository is deprecated since using Vulkan. Check out https://github.com/ShenCiao/Ciallo for OpenGl implementation.

For myself, it's a nice practice about using Vulkan. But I'm pretty glad to switch back to OpenGL, it's late but much better than never. 

The lesson I've learned is that **never use raw Vulkan (or DX12) for your research project! (unless necessary)**.

The images or videos below are rendered in Vulkan.
